        <p>Our moms keep us on a pretty good schedule. They have to wake up <code>early</code> for work, so we get up with them. Sometimes we wake them before their alarm goes off. We think they like it when we help them stay on schedule.</p>
        <h4>The Best Part About Waking Up is FOOD</h4>
        <p>Just about every 12 hours, our moms serve us a <span class="bold">heaping</span> serving of <span class="italics">delicious</span> kibble. Oh, how we <span class="bold italics">loooove</span> kibble. Sometimes our kibble tastes like salmon. Sometimes it tastes like lamb, or turkey. Randall loves it when our moms pour some chicken broth on the kibble. He says that's the best!</p>

          <h3>Play, Play, All Day</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Playtime is our <span class="bold">favorite</span> time of day! There are all kinds of things we like to play with.</p>
        <ul class="toys">
          <li>Bones</li>
          <li>Stuffed Animals</li>
          <li>My Mom's Shoes</li>
          <li>Empty Water Bottles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes, our moms take us outside to play in our backyard. There, we run all around; we play fetch, together; and we take walks, which is Eartha's favorite. It's like going on cool <code>adventures</code> a few times per week. </p>

          <h3>We Snooze, Yet We Never Lose</h3>
        </header>
        <p>When our moms leave for work, it is pretty boring around the house. So, we like to take naps. We nap together usually, but sometimes Randall gets <s>annoyed</s> by his younger sister, Eartha. In these instances, Randall naps in his kennel. It doesn't always help, because Eartha loves her big brother so much that she will sometimes squeeze into the kennel with him.</p>
        <p>We probably take 25 naps on days when our moms have work. When they're home, we would rather play. At night, when it's time to go to bed, we get to <span class="italics bold">cuddle</span>. Sometimes we fight over who gets to sleep in between our moms. Usually, Eartha will lay on top of her big brother if he doesn't let her <code>win</code>. Of course, that means Randall will eventually move to become more comfortable.</p>

        <p>Randall joined the <code>family</code> in 2018 at only 6 weeks old. He was a present for our Mom's 25th birthday. As a puppy, he really favored his father, a medium sized rednose <span class="bold-small">Pitbull Terrier</span>. However, in his older years, he definitely favors his mother, more. She was a <span class="bold-small">Miniature Schnauzer</span>.</p>


        <p><span class="center">Some of Randall's favorite things:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visit the Local Dog Park</li>
          <li>Belly Rubs && Butt Scratches</li>
          <li>Snack with his Mommies</li>
          <li>Bark at other Dogs on the T.V.</li>
        </ul>

        <header class="Eartha_Mae_Kitt"><h3>Eartha Mae Kitt</h3></header>
        <p>Eartha was the most recent addition to our family. She was only at the <span class="bold-small">Humane Society</span> for a few weeks before our moms met her. On a rainy evening in June, they went to visit the <code>shelter</code> on a whim. That same morning, Eartha had been deemed healthy enough to be <span class="bold-small">adopted</span>. Her sniffles were gone and she was eating her food regularly again. It was love at first sight!</p>
        <p>When she came out of the puppy ward, she was very energetic. Eartha gave both of her future moms <span class="italics">kisses</span> like she had known them all of her life. They agreed to adopt her immediately. They had to wait hours for the vet to give the final OK. During that time, there were several other families that saw Eartha online and were attempting to adopt the 100% <span class="bold-small"> Boston Terrier</span>, as well. <span class="bold italics">Too bad for them! </span> We got her first. Eartha is now almost 10 months old. She's been with us for 4 months and we couldn't imagine our family without her. </p>
